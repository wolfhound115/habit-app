This is where all of my static files will be placed BY ME 
because I included this in the filepath for STATICFILES_DIRS in settings.py

the static folder is autogenerated from all static files in the project by running python manage.py collectstatic
the static folder is NOT where i put files that I want to use because django wont look there for my files (like CSS etc)
this confused me so much until today
