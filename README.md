# habit@
**habit@** is a web app drawing inspiration from popular apps such as Instagram and Snapchat to create a supportive community where users can build habits together. 

Users create a schedule for when they plan to practice their new habits and post photos on the scheduled check-in dates as proof for following through with their goals. Users can follow one another and interact with eachother's posts via liking and commenting as a social media app. Users are also incentivized to continuously work on their habits as consecutive successful check-ins allow users to build up streaks to show off their consistency in habit building! Occasionally in life things do come up, so in order to allow for some forgiveness a missed check-in won't break a user's streak as long as they never miss 2 check-ins in a row. As they say, sometimes you just need a little nudge to get your feet to the gym and then chances are you'll work out before you decide to head back home. 

Let's make this year your year! Happy Habit Building!
